                    Hello world! My name is Kianna Willmore. I am an <b>18 year old student</b> attending <b>Algonquin College</b>. This my 1<sup>st</sup> year attending, and I am excited to join clubs such as <em>rock climbing, gaming, and art</em>. I hope to learn lots of useful skills during my two year program, including how to use <abbr title="Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom">Adobe programs</abbr>, and code in <abbr title="Microsoft Visual Studio Code (Version 1.74)">Visual Studio</abbr>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of my <b>favourite</b> hobbies include <em>swimming, skateboarding, drawing and painting</em>. I find art and fitness to be very relaxing, since it helps me feel at ease and clear my mind of stress. My first ever drawing tablet was given to me on my 15<sup>th</sup> brithday, and I was <em>very</em> excited to explore the world of <b>digital art</b>. Since getting my first tablet, I've been trying my hand at <abbr title="Two Dimensional">2D</abbr> animation, and illustration. I believe that the best career for me would involve <b>art, travel, and creativity</b>.
